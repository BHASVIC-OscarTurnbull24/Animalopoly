# Animalopoly
In this project, I worked in a group and was tasked with creating a monopoly-like game in Java with abilities for mutliple players to roll dice to move around a board and as they go they can purchase different animals and upgrade them which grants them money if another player lands on the animals. I learnt from this project the benefits of modular design when designing programs as using Java allowed the game system to be divided into different classes which each were responsible for a different area of the game which made the designing of the system more intuitive and made the project easier to code as classes could be instantiated as many times as needed.
